    <h1>Classic Nigerian Jollof Rice</h1>

    <h2 class="recipe-page">Description</h2>
    <p>Rice dishes are very common in most West-African cultures and the Nigerian jollof rice is one of many great variations. 
        Jollof rice itself is popular in countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal. Like I said in my food in theory article 
        Nigerian Jollof 101 - Extras & Essentials, the debate on which country makes the best Jollof is one that could go on forever. 
        As a Nigerian, I can say that aside from the taste and flavour, a beautiful thing about the Nigerian Jollof rice dish is how it varies. 
        From the classic Jollof to party style Jollof and a recent favourite that is basmati Jollof and more.

        <li>1 thumb-size fresh ginger</li>
        <li>2 garlic gloves</li>
        <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 cup long-grain rice (Washed)</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ tsp nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>

        <li>1 cup vegetable stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="recipe-page">Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Chop the tomatoes, onions, and bell pepper into chunks. Place into a blender/food processor together with the ginger, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. Then blitz into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Place a pot over medium heat, pour in the sunflower oil, and add the blended mixture. Stir and allow to sizzle, then place a lid over it, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>After simmering for 20 minutes, remove the lid, then add the spices and seasonings (Paprika, thyme, nutmeg, bay leaf, and salt). Stir altogether.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Also pour in the rice and vegetable or meat stock and stir together.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Place a piece of aluminium foil into the pot, covering the entire surface of the rice (this will keep the steam in), then place a lid over the pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (Stirring occasionally to cook the rice evenly and also to prevent it from burning at the bottom).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Remove lid, bin the aluminium foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Now the rice should be ready to serve. Serve hot with your favourite sides and enjoy!</li>
