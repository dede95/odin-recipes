                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Place a plastic bag or cling wrap over the chicken and pound to 
                        even thickness 2cm / 4/5" thick. Sprinkle both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Heat oil and melt 1 tbsp butter in a large skillet over high heat. 
                        Add chicken and cook for 3 minutes or until golden, then turn and cook the other side for 3 minutes. 
                        Transfer to plate, cover loosely with foil.</li>

                <h3>Gravy:</h3>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Add 1 tbsp butter to the skillet. Add mushrooms and cook for 3 minutes or until pretty golden.</li>
                    <li>Add remaining 1 tbsp butter and garlic. Cook for 1 minute until mushrooms are golden.</li>
                    <li>Turn heat DOWN to medium. Add flour and mix for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add about 1/4 of the beef broth, mixing as you go. Once incorporated, add remaining broth gradually,
                        mixing constantly. This is key to avoid lumps in gravy. Use a whisk if needed (works fine even with 
                        mushrooms in there) (Note 3 for beginner option).</li>
                    <li>Cook gravy for about 2 minutes or until it thickens to your taste - remember it will thicken more as
                        it cools when serving. Adjust salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>If you want, return chicken to the pan and turn to coat in gravy.</li>
                    <li>Place chicken on serving plates, top with gravy. Best served with mashed potato or similar to
                        optimise the mushroom gravy experience!</li>
